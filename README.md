# Multi-Class-Image-Classification-on-MNIST


Classified a given image of size 28 x 28 pixels of a handwritten digit into one of 10 classes representing integer
values from 0 to 9.


Assimilated and compared various machine learning algorithms like SVM, Decision Tree, MLP, etc. based
on execution time and classification matrix. Also used ensemble learning methods like bagging and
boosting and built them from scratch to achieve improvement.
